# Educational Course Demand Prediction System

## Introduction

This implementation plan outlines the steps required to execute and implement the Educational Course Demand Prediction System using the Flask framework, which is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. The system will utilize historical enrollment data for BSCS, BSIT, and BSIS courses to predict course demand and estimate future enrollments accurately.

## Project Overview

The Educational Course Demand Prediction System aims to provide insights into future enrollment trends for educational institutions. It leverages historical enrollment data for three courses: BSCS, BSIT, and BSIS, to develop a Linear Regression model for predicting course demand. The system will include features like admin controls, user login, a dashboard for data visualization, prediction modules, and database management.

## Implementation Steps

### Environment Setup

- Install Python and necessary libraries (e.g., Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, SQLAlchemy).
- Set up a virtual environment for the project to isolate dependencies.

### Database Configuration

- Design the database schema for storing historical enrollment data.
- Create a database using an appropriate database management system (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- Write scripts to populate the database with historical enrollment data.

### Flask Application Setup

- Create a Flask project directory structure.
- Define routes and views for user authentication (login, registration), dashboard, and administrative controls.
- Implement templates for web pages.

### Machine Learning Model

- Preprocess historical enrollment data, including cleaning and feature engineering.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Develop and train a Linear Regression model using Scikit-Learn.
- Save the trained model for future predictions.

### Dashboard Development

- Implement a user-friendly dashboard for data visualization using web technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Integrate the machine learning model to make real-time course demand predictions.
- Display historical data and predictions graphically.

### User Authentication

- Implement user authentication using Flask-Login for admin and user roles.
- Create a registration system for new users.

### Admin Controls

- Develop admin interfaces for data management, model retraining, and database management.
- Secure admin access with proper authentication and authorization.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Perform unit testing for each component of the system.
- Conduct user acceptance testing to ensure functionality and usability.
- Address and fix any identified issues and bugs.

### Deployment

- Choose a hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) and deploy the Flask application.
- Configure the database connection for the deployed system.
- Set up a domain name and SSL certificate for secure access.

### Documentation and Training

- Create user and admin documentation to guide users on how to use the system.
- Provide training to system administrators and users as needed.

### Maintenance and Updates

- Regularly monitor the system for performance and security.
- Implement updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements as required.

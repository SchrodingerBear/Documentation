# Chapter 3: Design & Methodology

In this chapter, we will discuss the methodology used to develop the proposed project, which is a system built using Flask and employs the Linear Regression algorithm for predicting course demand and estimating future enrollment. We will also address the technical requirements of the system, including software, data, and hardware, and provide a detailed explanation of the system's design and architecture.

## 3.1 Software and Web Framework

The chosen software framework for this project is Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python. Flask was selected for its simplicity and flexibility, making it suitable for developing a web-based application with features such as admin controls, login, dashboard, prediction, and database management.

## 3.2 Data Points and Relevance

The data points used in this project include historical enrollment data for three courses: BSCS (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science), BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology), and BSIS (Bachelor of Science in Information Systems). These data points are crucial for training the Linear Regression algorithm to predict course demand and estimate future enrollment accurately.

### 3.3.1 Input-Process-Output (IPO) Diagram

Input: Historical enrollment data for BSCS, BSIT, and BSIS.
Process: Training the Linear Regression algorithm.
Output: Predicted course demand and future enrollment numbers.

The relationship between predicting course demand and estimating future enrollment is that the prediction of course demand is a part of estimating future enrollment. By predicting course demand, we can make informed decisions about how many students are likely to enroll in each course in the future.

### 3.3.2 System Architecture

The system architecture follows a client-server approach, where the Flask application serves as the server. The integration of machine learning in the study involves the incorporation of the Linear Regression model for predictive analysis. The components and layers of the system include:
- **Presentation Layer:** The user interface accessible through the web browser.
- **Application Layer:** Implemented in Flask, handling user requests and responses.
- **Machine Learning Layer:** Housing the Linear Regression model for course demand prediction.
- **Database Layer:** Storing historical enrollment data and user information.

The Data Flow Diagram depicts the flow of data within the system, including data input, processing, and output.

## 3.6 Technical Requirements

### 3.6.1 Data Requirements

The system relies on historical enrollment data for BSCS, BSIT, and BSIS as its primary data source. This data must be collected, cleaned, and formatted for use in training the Linear Regression model.

### 3.6.2 Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements for the system are minimal, as Flask is a lightweight framework. A standard web server with sufficient processing power and memory should suffice.

### 3.6.3 Software Requirements

The following software components are required for the system:
- Python for developing the Flask application.
- Flask web framework for building the web-based system.
- Libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn for implementing the Linear Regression algorithm.
- A database management system (e.g., MySQL) for storing and managing historical enrollment data.

## 3.7 Citation of Software Development Model

The software development model used for this project is the Agile methodology. Agile was chosen for its iterative and flexible approach, allowing for incremental development and adjustments based on stakeholder feedback.

In this chapter, we have outlined the methodology, software and web framework, data points, system development diagrams, and technical requirements used in the development of the proposed system. The system's primary features, including admin controls, login, dashboard, prediction, and database management, have also been discussed.
